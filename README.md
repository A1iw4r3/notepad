Simple Text Editor with Tkinter
This project implements a simple yet functional text editor using Python's Tkinter library. The TextEditor class provides a graphical interface for creating, opening, editing, and saving text files. Key features include a rich text area that supports basic text formatting such as bold, italic, and underline, as well as a customizable font size. The text editor interface consists of a menu bar with "File" and "Edit" menus. The "File" menu allows users to open and save files, while the "Edit" menu provides options to change font size and apply text formatting styles. Additionally, a status bar at the bottom of the window keeps users informed about the current status of the editor, such as when a file is saved.

The editor is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Users can easily open existing text files using the file dialog, make edits, and save their changes. The font size can be adjusted through a submenu, providing flexibility for different viewing preferences. Text formatting is managed with toggle buttons for bold, italic, and underline styles. These features make the editor a versatile tool for basic text editing tasks. The implementation leverages Tkinter's robust GUI capabilities, making it a lightweight and effective solution for everyday text editing needs. The code is structured to be easily extendable, allowing for future enhancements and additional features.
